##Programs so Far
*   chinese-remainder-theorem.c -- uses the chinese remander theorem to compute a solution to many modular congruences. (Note: a precondition, for now at least, is that the moduli of different congruences are coprime to each other, or else the program is not guaranteed to succeed).
